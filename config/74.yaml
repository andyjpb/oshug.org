            <p>At this evening meeting in London on Thursday 20 June we have two talks, with a total of five speakers looking at makerspace. We last looked at this topic in <a href="/event/40">April 2015</a>, and in the intervening time the maker movement has evolved often, but not always, for the better.</p>
            <p>This is a joint meeting with the <a href="https://ossg.bcs.org/">British Computer Society Open Source Specialist Group</a>.</p>
