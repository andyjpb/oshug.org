title:      Inaugural London RISC-V meetup
description: |
            <p>This will be the inaugural London meetup for the RISC-V
            community, hosted by the BCS Open Source Specialist Group and the
            UK Open Source Hardware User Group.  As with the other UK meetups,
            we provide an opportunity to share the latest ideas around the
            RISC-V ecosystem, combined with plenty of time for
            networking. However unlike other meetups, the London meetup will
            have a specific focus on the open source aspects of RISC-V.</p>
            <p>This is a joint meeting with the <a href="https://ossg.bcs.org/">British Computer Society Open Source Specialist Group</a>.</p>

            <h3>The LowRISC project</h3>

            <p id="lowrisc">Alex Bradbury will talk about lowRISC, a non-profit
            community interest company, using collaborative engineering to
            develop and maintain open source silicon designs and tools.  Their
            expertise includes processor and SoC design, with a particular
            focus on hardware security, design verification, RISC-V tools, and
            the LLVM compiler.<p>

            <h3>The XCrypt instruction set extension</h3>

            <p id="xcrypt">Ben Marshall will talk about his work at Bristol
            University on the SCARV project: a side-channel hardened RISC-V
            platform. Heâ€™ll introduce the XCrypt instruction set extension for
            RISC-V.</p>
